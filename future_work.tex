\section{Future Work}
In our experimentation, we noticed that the time needed to verify a specific 
property of a network is not solely determined by the network's size. It's possible 
that a larger network can be verified quickly, while a smaller one may take longer 
or even fail to be verified altogether. In the future, our objective is to conduct a 
comprehensive investigation into the underlying reasons for this occurrence.

In the future, we also want to find an improved metric for semantic closeness factor
that considers the overall semantic behavior of the network during abstraction 
processes.
